NYU Silver,"June 20 to June 30, 2023","From June 20 to June 30, 2023, the Constance and Martin Silver Center on Data Science and Social Equity (C+M Silver Center) at the New York University Silver School of Social Work will sponsor and host the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science, in partnership with New York University Silver School of Social Work. The purpose of the Summer Institute is to bring together graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and beginning faculty interested in computational social science, with a focus on social equity and social good. The Summer Institute is for both social scientists (broadly conceived) and data scientists (broadly conceived).

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects. There will also be presentations from computational social science researchers working in a variety of settings, such as academia, industry, and government. The site-specific focus of SICSS-NYU Silver is data science for social equity. Topics covered include (but are not limited to):

Social impact of data science: challenges, opportunities, and ethics
  Data collection
    Application Programming Interface (API)
      Social media as research tools for social sciences
      Web scraping
      Government’s open data
    
  Data analysis
    Natural Language Processing
      Machine Learning
    
The first week of the program will focus on training and group exercises, and the second week will provide participants with opportunities to launch collaborative research projects. There will be ample opportunities for students to discuss their ideas and research with the organizers, other participants, and visiting speakers. Because we are committed to open and reproducible research, all materials created by faculty and students for the Summer Institute will be released via open source.

Participation is restricted to early career researchers who are able to attend the program in-person in New York City. We welcome applicants from all backgrounds and fields of study, especially applicants from groups currently under-represented in computational social science. Participants with less experience in social science research will be provided with additional readings in advance of the Institute, and participants with less experience coding and computational applications will be provided with a set of online learning modules. Students doing this preparatory work will be supported by a teaching assistant who will hold online office hours before the Institute.

About 20 participants will be invited, and participants are expected to fully attend and participate in the entire 9-day program. Participation is free - the NYU C+M Silver Center will cover the costs of tuition, projects, activities, and lunch. However, participants are responsible for bringing a laptop to the program (WiFi access will be provided), and arranging their own accommodation and travel for the program. We are currently unable to provide travel and lodging funds for institute participants.

Application materials are due due March 31, 2023 at 11:59pm. Inquiries may be sent to silver.cmscenter@nyu.edu.

Montréal,"June 12 to June 30, 2023","English follows!

Du lundi 12 juin au vendredi 30 juin 2023, la faculté des sciences humaines de l’Université du Québec à Montréal parrainera l’Institut d’été en sciences sociales computationnelles. Le but de l’Institut d’été sert à former ceux et celles qui souhaitent situer leur travail académique et professionnelle à l’intersection des sciences sociales et des sciences des données. L’Institut d’été s’adresse à la fois aux spécialistes des sciences sociales (au sens large) et aux scientifiques des données (au sens large). Il est ouvert aux étudiants des deuxième et troisième cycle, des chercheurs postdoctoraux et des professeurs débutants intéressés par les sciences sociales computationnelles. Cet Institut est co-organisé par Vissého Adjiwanou, professeur au département de sociologie de l’Université du Québec à Montréal et Xavier St-Denis, professeur à l’Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS).

Le programme d’enseignement comprendra des cours le matin, les laboratoires et présentations de conférenciers invités l’après-midi. La première semaine de formation (du 12 au 16 juin) se tiendra en ligne et aura pour but de renforcer les compétences en programmation à R des participants. La deuxième semaine (19 au 23 juin) sera consacrée à la formation en collecte de données digitales (web scraping, utilisation de API), à l’analyse quantitative de textes et à l’analyse de réseaux. Les compétences en méthodes quantitatives usuelles et aux problèmes méthodologiques (biais de mesure, représentativité, causalité …) associées aux approches quantitatives seront discutés tout au long de l’Institut. A l’issue de ces deux premières semaines, les participants seront assez outillés pour entreprendre dans la troisième et dernière semaine un travail de recherche en équipe. Les participants auront de nombreuses occasions de discuter de leurs idées et de leurs recherches avec les organisateurs, les autres participants et les conférenciers/conférencières invité.es. Parce que nous nous engageons à une recherche ouverte et reproductible, tous les matériaux créés par les professeurs et les étudiants pour l’Institut d’été seront publiés en open source.

La participation est limitée aux étudiants de maîtrise et de doctorat, aux chercheurs postdoctoraux, et aux professeurs non titulaires. Cette année, les étudiants ont la choix entre participer à l’institut comme un cours de cycle supérieur SOC8990 qu’ils peuvent se faire créditer, ou une participation autonome à l’institut. Pour ceux qui veulent avoir une attestation de participation et se faire créditer, ils doivent s’inscrire en cliquant sur ce lien. Tous les autres doivent s’incrire à partir de ce lien. Nous accueillons des candidats de tous horizons et domaines d’études. Une trentaine de participants seront invités; ils devraient assister et participer pleinement à l’ensemble du programme des trois semaines (12 au 30 juin). Les participants ayant moins d’expérience en recherche en sciences sociales devront effectuer des lectures supplémentaires avant l’Institut, et les participants ayant moins d’expérience en codage devront compléter un ensemble de modules d’apprentissage en ligne sur le langage de programmation R, et suivre le cours intensif en R (12 au 16 juin). Les étudiants effectuant ce travail préparatoire seront soutenus par des assistants d’enseignement qui tiendront des heures de bureau en ligne avant l’Institut.

Les documents de candidature sont dus le vendredi 28 avril 2023 à 11: 59. Nous informerons les candidats uniquement par e-mail avant le début du mois d’Avril et demanderons aux participants de confirmer leur participation très peu de temps après. Les demandes de renseignements peuvent être envoyées à sicss.montreal@gmail.com.
