Du lundi 12 juin au vendredi 30 juin 2023, la faculté des sciences humaines de l’Université du Québec à Montréal parrainera l’Institut d’été en sciences sociales computationnelles. Le but de l’Institut d’été sert à former ceux et celles qui souhaitent situer leur travail académique et professionnelle à l’intersection des sciences sociales et des sciences des données. L’Institut d’été s’adresse à la fois aux spécialistes des sciences sociales (au sens large) et aux scientifiques des données (au sens large). Il est ouvert aux étudiants des deuxième et troisième cycle, des chercheurs postdoctoraux et des professeurs débutants intéressés par les sciences sociales computationnelles. Cet Institut est co-organisé par Vissého Adjiwanou, professeur au département de sociologie de l’Université du Québec à Montréal et Xavier St-Denis, professeur à l’Institut national de la recherche scientifique (INRS).

Le programme d’enseignement comprendra des cours le matin, les laboratoires et présentations de conférenciers invités l’après-midi. La première semaine de formation (du 12 au 16 juin) se tiendra en ligne et aura pour but de renforcer les compétences en programmation à R des participants. La deuxième semaine (19 au 23 juin) sera consacrée à la formation en collecte de données digitales (web scraping, utilisation de API), à l’analyse quantitative de textes et à l’analyse de réseaux. Les compétences en méthodes quantitatives usuelles et aux problèmes méthodologiques (biais de mesure, représentativité, causalité …) associées aux approches quantitatives seront discutés tout au long de l’Institut. A l’issue de ces deux premières semaines, les participants seront assez outillés pour entreprendre dans la troisième et dernière semaine un travail de recherche en équipe. Les participants auront de nombreuses occasions de discuter de leurs idées et de leurs recherches avec les organisateurs, les autres participants et les conférenciers/conférencières invité.es. Parce que nous nous engageons à une recherche ouverte et reproductible, tous les matériaux créés par les professeurs et les étudiants pour l’Institut d’été seront publiés en open source.

La participation est limitée aux étudiants de maîtrise et de doctorat, aux chercheurs postdoctoraux, et aux professeurs non titulaires. Cette année, les étudiants ont la choix entre participer à l’institut comme un cours de cycle supérieur SOC8990 qu’ils peuvent se faire créditer, ou une participation autonome à l’institut. Pour ceux qui veulent avoir une attestation de participation et se faire créditer, ils doivent s’inscrire en cliquant sur ce lien. Tous les autres doivent s’incrire à partir de ce lien. Nous accueillons des candidats de tous horizons et domaines d’études. Une trentaine de participants seront invités; ils devraient assister et participer pleinement à l’ensemble du programme des trois semaines (12 au 30 juin). Les participants ayant moins d’expérience en recherche en sciences sociales devront effectuer des lectures supplémentaires avant l’Institut, et les participants ayant moins d’expérience en codage devront compléter un ensemble de modules d’apprentissage en ligne sur le langage de programmation R, et suivre le cours intensif en R (12 au 16 juin). Les étudiants effectuant ce travail préparatoire seront soutenus par des assistants d’enseignement qui tiendront des heures de bureau en ligne avant l’Institut.

Les documents de candidature sont dus le vendredi 28 avril 2023 à 11: 59. Nous informerons les candidats uniquement par e-mail avant le début du mois d’Avril et demanderons aux participants de confirmer leur participation très peu de temps après.

Du lundi 7 juin au vendredi 25 juin 2021, la fondation Russell Sage parrainera l’Institut d’été en sciences sociales computationnelles, qui se tiendra virtuellement à l ‘Université du Québec à Montréal. Le but de l’Institut d’été sert à former ceux qui souhaitent situer leur travail académique à l’intersection des sciences sociales et de la science des données. À cet égard, nous sommes motivés à développer de nouvelles recherche sur les inégalités, la mobilité sociale, la formation de l’opinion publique, le comportement politique, les réseaux de médias sociaux et d’autres sujets connexes. L’Institut d’été s’adresse à la fois aux spécialistes des sciences sociales (au sens large) et aux scientifiques des données (au sens large). Il est ouvert aux étudiants diplômés, des chercheurs postdoctoraux et des professeurs débutants intéressés par les sciences sociales computationnelles. L’organisateur et professeur principal de l’Institut d’été est Vissého Adjiwanou, professeur au département de sociologie de l’Université du Québec à Montréal.

Le programme d’enseignement comprendra des cours, des problèmes de groupe et des projets de recherche dirigés par des participants. Il y aura également des conférenciers/conférencières extérieur.es qui mènent des recherches en sciences sociales computationnelles dans divers contextes, tels que le milieu universitaire, l’industrie et le gouvernement. Les sujets abordés incluent le texte sous forme de données, le grattage de sites Web, les expériences numériques sur le terrain, l’échantillonnage non probabiliste, la collaboration de masse, l’apprentissage automatique et l’éthique. Les participants auront de nombreuses occasions de discuter de leurs idées et de leurs recherches avec les organisateurs, les autres participants et les conférenciers/conférencières invité.es. Parce que nous nous engageons à une recherche ouverte et reproductible, tous les matériaux créés par les professeurs et les étudiants pour l’Institut d’été seront publiés en open source.

La participation est limitée aux étudiant.es au doctorat, chercheurs postdoctoraux, professeurs non titulaires dans les 7 ans suivant leur doctorat, et exceptionnellement aux étudiants en master (ceux qui terminent leur mémoire). Nous accueillons des candidats de tous horizons et domaines d’études, en particulier des candidats issus de groupes actuellement sous-représentés en sciences sociales computationnelles. Une trentaine de participant.es seront invité.es, et les participant.es devraient assister et participer pleinement à l’ensemble du programme des deux semaines (14 au 25 juin). Les participants ayant moins d’expérience en recherche en sciences sociales devront effectuer des lectures supplémentaires avant l’Institut, et les participants ayant moins d’expérience en codage devront compléter un ensemble de modules d’apprentissage en ligne sur le langage de programmation R, et suivre le cours intensif en R (7 au 11 juin). Les étudiants effectuant ce travail préparatoire seront soutenus par des assistants d’enseignement qui tiendront des heures de bureau en ligne avant l’Institut.

Les documents de candidature sont dus le vendredi 30 avril 2021 à 11: 59. Nous informerons les candidats uniquement par e-mail avant le début du mois de mai et demanderons aux participants de confirmer leur participation très peu de temps après. Les demandes de renseignements peuvent être envoyées à sicss.montreal@gmail.com.

Bay Area,"June 15 to July 3, 2020","Updates

BAY-SICSS is going virtual! We are adapting our partner site from UC Berkeley campus to an online format, but will continue our thematic focus on computational social science in partnership with Bay Area nonprofits. We are working with SICSS-Duke, our partners, and guest speakers to balance flexibility with our goal of creating a community of community engaged scholars.

The instructional program will involve lectures, group problem sets, and participant-led research projects, held concurrently with SICSS-Duke. In the second part of the institute, participants will co-develop a project with Bay Area nonprofits in health, criminal justice, and civil society. Where we originally envisioned this project as a one-week, full time experience, we will be shifting this project to a two-week, part-time project to give our participants and partners more flexibility.

Thanks to everyone who applied to participate in BAY-SICSS. We are currently reviewing applications and expect to contact participants in mid-late May.

Overview
